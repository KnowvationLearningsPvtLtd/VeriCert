2. Inputs recipient data → Generates certificate
3. System creates QR code → Stores in database
4. Sends email to recipient

#### Verification Flow
1. User scans QR code/enters ID
2. System retrieves certificate data
3. Validates authenticity
4. Displays verification result

## **4. System Design**

### 4.1 Database Schema

#### User Collection
\`\`\`typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  role: "admin" | "organization" | "user";
  createdAt: Date;
}
\`\`\`

#### Certificate Collection
\`\`\`typescript
interface Certificate {
  id: string;
  recipientName: string;
  recipientEmail: string;
  course: string;
  issueDate: Date;
  qrCode: string;
  templateId: string;
  issuerId: string;
}
\`\`\`

### 4.2 API Endpoints

#### Authentication
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/logout

#### Certificate Management
- POST /issuer/certificates
- GET /issuer/certificates/:id
- GET /issuer/certificates/:id/qr
- POST /issuer/certificates/send-batch

#### Public Routes
- GET /public/verify-certificate/:id
